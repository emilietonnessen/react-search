# Search with React and TypeScript
The application is created and coded with React and TypeScript. The search functionality is managed by State and using the filter() method to display the relevant search results.

I've made use of React Lifecycle to fetch data from the API, and then assigning the fetched data to the state.

The application is styled with Sass and is mobile responsive.

## Changes made to the /server 
- Added 'cors' to the server as I was getting an error in console with CORS.

## What is the extra branch?
I might have misunderstood the third exercise as I was trying to implement a search function in the url, but ran out of time and knowledge to implement that.

(if you would type  this "http://localhost:3000/?search=amundsen") in the url, then you would get "amundsen" in the search field and search result)
